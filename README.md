# Machine-Learning-Neural-Net
The purpose of this project was to implement necessary functions for a neural net and a deep neural net with multiple layers. The data set included hand written digits which were split into training and testing data sets to determine if the net could be trained to correctly recognize these digits. The influence of hyper parameters was tested against accuracy and performance. The parameters tested were the regularization term and number of hyper units. For the deep neural net The parameter tested was number of layers against accuracy and performance. Results with both plots and explanations can be seen under the report section.
